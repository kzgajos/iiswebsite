Advertising supports many key services on the web, such as search
engines like Google. However, research has shown that many consumers
consider such advertising to be relatively unhelpful -- or even
untrustworthy. Left unaddressed, this misalignment between consumers,
advertisers, and the services that require both to succeed could
undermine the fundamental economics of the Internet.

<p>
The purpose of this project is to examine this problem from the
perspective of intelligent interactive systems to determine if new
features could be applied to online advertising to make it more
helpful and more trustworthy. For example, ads might incorporate
real-time, independent information and "trust signals" from
authoritative third-party sites.
