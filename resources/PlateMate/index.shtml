<H3>Overview</h3>
<p>
This data set includes 16 out of 18 images used in the evaluation of the accuracy of PlateMate.  Included is also a spreadsheet providing ground truth nutritional information for a meal shown in each photo (as reported by a preparer or manufacturer) as well as PlateMate estimates and estimates by 3 expert nutritionists.  We also include estimates provided by the MealSnap iPhone app (evaluated in April of 2011).

<h3>Data</h3>
<img src="/resources/PlateMate/platemate-example.jpg" width="200" align="right" alt="Example of a meal photograph used in the evaluation of accuracy of PlateMate estimates"/>
<p>
	The data set is provided as a <a href="resources/PlateMate/PlateMateGroundTruthEvaluationDataSet.zip">single .zip file</a>.  It contains a directory with 16 food photographs and an Excel spreadsheet containing the analysis results.  Note that some photographs present complex meals: PlateMate divides the analysis of such meals into analyses of individual component foods.  For example, with the photograph shown here, PlateMate will start by dividing the meal into three components: pulled chicken sandwich, broccoli and potato wedges.  The Excel spreadsheet includes a separate column for each <em>food</em> shown in each of the photographs.  The comparisons to other systems, however, are performed at the level of entire meals.
