<h3>About The Group</h3>
<p>
The Intelligent Interactive Systems Group at Harvard was founded in
September of 2009.  We are interested in how intelligent technologies
can enable novel ways of interacting with computation, and in the new
challenges that human abilities, limitations and preferences create
for machine learning algorithms embedded in interactive systems.
</p>

<h3>About Intelligent Interactive Systems</h3>
<p>Intelligent Interactive Systems are fundamentally hard to design
because they require intelligent technology that is well suited for
people's abilities, limitations, and preferences; they also require
entirely novel interactions that can give the user a predictable and
reliable experience despite the fact that the underlying technology is
inherently proactive, unpredictable, and occasionally wrong.  Thus,
design of successful intelligent interactive systems requires intimate
knowledge of and ability to innovate in two very disparate areas:
<span class="bigemph">human-computer interaction</span> and <span class="bigemph">artificial intelligence</span> or <span class="bigemph">machine
learning</span>.</p>

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>
Our <a href="projects/">projects</a> span the full range from formal user studies to
statistical machine learning.  
We have worked on developing new intelligent <span class="bigemph">technologies</span> to enable novel interactions (e.g., <a class="external" href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~kgajos/research/supple/">SUPPLE system</a>) and on understanding the <span class="bigemph">principles</span> underlying how people interact with intelligent systems (e.g., the <a href="projects/#aui">project on exploring the design space of adaptive user interfaces</a>).  Our <a href="projects/#bci">Brain-Computer Interface project</a> aims at developing a new set of <span class="bigemph">interactions</span> for efficiently controlling complex applications, and we are also interested in building and studying complete <span class="bigemph">applications</span>.  One particular area of inteterest is the <a href="projects/#ability">ability-based user interfaces</a> -- an approach for adapting interactions to the individual abilities of people with impairments or of able-bodied people in unusual situations.
