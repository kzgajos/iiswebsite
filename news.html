<h3>2017</h3>

<p><b>Wednesday, Feb 1:</b>
<a href="papers/2017/boronow17derbi.shtml">Our new paper in Environmental Health Perspectives</a>: a system to report back individual results of biomonitoring studies to study participants. In the past, researchers feared that people could not handle the complex and potentially upsetting information about what chemicals were found in their tissues and environment. No more. If results are presented correctly, participants can understand and act on the results. Our system makes it easier to author and deliver personalized results at scale.
This work was led by our colleagues at the <a href="http://www.silentspring.org" class="external">Silent Spring Institute</a>.

<p><b>Monday, January 16:</b>
<a href="papers/2017/booth17piggybacking.shtml">
Our upcoming HRI'17 paper</a> led by Serena Booth: can a robot talk its way into an access-controlled student dormitory? Robot succeeded in getting past the locked door 19% of the time when it asked an individual student to let it enter. When it asked a group of students, it succeed 76% of the time! But when the robot was dressed as a food delivery agent for the fictional start-up Robot Grub (and was carrying a box of cookies in a clear case), individuals suddenly became much more trusting: 71% of the individuals allowed the cookie-carrying robot into the dorm. Surprisingly, people who identified the robot as a potential bomb threat were just as likely to open the door as those who did not.</p>
<p>
These results demonstrate the existence of overtrust---the belief that the robot does not intend to deceive or carry risk.

<a href="papers/2017/gajos17personality.shtml">Our upcoming ACM IUI 2017 paper</a> reports new findings from the <a href="http://multitasking.labinthewild.org/multitasking/" class="external">Multitasking Test</a> on LabintheWild: given a choice to either do more clicking or exert more mental effort to get a job done, introverts and people with high need for cognition lean toward more mental effort, while extroverts and people with low need for cognition click more. This suggests that not all people benefit equally from some of the effort saving features of modern user interfaces.

A new paper: <a href="papers/2016/skim16acceptance.pdf">Acceptance of Mobile Technology by Older Adults: A Preliminary Study"</a> led by <a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~sunyoungkim/" class="external">Sunyoung Kim</a>, to be presented at MobileHCI '16 in Florence.
This paper captures the results of our deep dive into the grounded theory method to understand how older adults make decisions about adopting (or not adopting) new mobile technologies. A <b>key finding</b> is that even if an older adult perceives a technology as useful and easy to use by others, they may still decide that the technology is too difficult for them to learn. This explicit stage of evaluating the ease of learning a new technology appears to be specific to older adults and does not appear in other technology adoption models.

<h3>2010</h3>

<p>
<b>Tuesday, November 23:</b> Our <a
href="http://www.is.umbc.edu/DynamicAccessibilityWorkshop/index.html"
class="external">workshop on <b>Dynamic Accessibility: Detecting and
Accommodating Differences in Ability and Situation</b></a>
(co-organized with collaborators from UMBC, University of Washington,
and IBM Research) has been accepted for CHI 2011.  The goal of this
workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners in
accessibility, mobile HCI, and interactive intelligent systems who are
pursuing agile, data-driven approaches that enable interactive systems
to adapt or become adapted to the needs and abilities of a particular
individual in a particular context.  Tbe workshop is motivated by an
observation that human abilities are idiosyncratic and may change
frequently. Static one-size-fits-many accessibility solutions miss the
opportunities that arise from careful consideration of an individual's
abilities and fail to address the sometimes dynamic aspect of those
abilities, such as when a user's activity or context causes a
"situational impairment."  See the <a
href="http://www.is.umbc.edu/DynamicAccessibilityWorkshop/index.html"
class="external">call for participation</a> or the <a
