<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="content">

In recent years, it has become possible for large groups of people to collaborate and generate ideas together in ways that were not possible before. However, the large number of ideas and participants in this setting also pose new challenges in helping people find inspiration from a large pool of ideas, and coordinating the collective effort. My research aims to address the challenges of large scale idea generation platforms by developing methods and systems for helping people make effective use of each other's ideas, and orchestrate collective effort to reduce redundancy and increase the breadth of generated ideas.
