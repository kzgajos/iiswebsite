<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="content">

Children with complex health conditions require care from a large, diverse set of caregivers that includes parents and community support organizations as well as multiple types of medical professionals. Coordination of their care is essential for good outcomes, and extensive research has shown that the use of integrated, team-based care plans improves care coordination. Care plans, however, are rarely deployed in practice. This paper describes barriers to effective implementation of care plans in complex care revealed by a study of care providers treating such children. It draws on teamwork theories, identifying ways AI capabilities could enhance care plan use; describes the design of GoalKeeper, a system to support providers use of care plans; and describes initial work toward information sharing algorithms for such systems.
