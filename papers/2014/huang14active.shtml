<div class="content">

<p>Typical synthesizers only provide controls to the low-level parameters of sound synthesis, such as wave-shapes or filter envelopes.

To do this, our system learns functions that map from synthesizer control settings to perceived levels of high-level qualities.

We model the functions mapping from control-parameters to the degree of each high-level quality using Gaussian processes, a nonparametric Bayesian model. These models can adjust to the complexity of the function being learned, account for nonlinear interaction between control-parameters, and allow us to characterize the uncertainty about the functions being learned.</p><p>By tracking uncertainty about the functions being learned, we can use active learning to quickly calibrate the tool, by querying the user about the sounds the system expects to most improve its performance.
