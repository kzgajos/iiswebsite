<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="content">

With the proliferation of online labor markets and other social computing platforms, online experiments have become a low-cost and scalable way to empirically test hypotheses and mechanisms in both human computation and social science. Yet, despite the potential in designing more powerful and expressive on-line experiments using multiple subjects, researchers still face many technical and logistical difficulties. We see synchronous and longitudinal experiments involving real-time interaction between participants as a dual-use paradigm for both human computation and social science, and present TurkServer, a platform that facilitates these types of experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our work has the potential to make more fruitful online experiments accessible to researchers in many different fields.
