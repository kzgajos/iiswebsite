<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="content">

Many factors influence a user's visual perception of an interface (e.g., culture, gender, visual impairment). In general, interface researchers and designers have considered these factors in isolation, without considering the combined effect of every factor influencing the visual perception of the user. As a result, interfaces have been optimized for single factors (e.g., improving accessibility for individuals with low vision), at the expense of optimizing for the individual's visual perception experience (e.g., considering cultural preferences and lighting conditions while assisting users with low vision). In this workshop, we will begin the process of combining the broad range of visual perception knowledge to create a holistic approach to understanding users' visual perception. The resulting knowledge pool will be used for generating interfaces better suited to the full range of users' visual perception abilities.
