<p>Complex tasks such as treating patients with complex medical conditions, conducting research, co-authoring documents and developing software products are typically accomplished by teams. Teamwork in such settings is often loosely-coupled as team members assume different responsibilities that match their individual expertise. This decomposition of activities enables team members to function autonomously and requires team members to be aware of others' actions only if these actions interact with their own activities. However, identifying interactions between collaborators' activities can be challenging. As a result, team members are often overwhelmed by too much irrelevant information about others' activities, or lack important relevant information, both of which can lead to coordination failures. This thesis argues that intelligent information sharing methods that identify the information that is most relevant to each team member can reduce coordination overhead and improve team performance.</p><p>Through a study of teams caring for children with complex medical conditions, this thesis characterizes the coordination challenges of loosely-coupled teams and formalizes the problem of information sharing in such teams.
