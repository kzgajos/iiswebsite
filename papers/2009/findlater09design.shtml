<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="content">

Adaptive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have the potential to improve performance and user satisfaction by automatically tailoring the presentation of functionality to each individual user. In practice, however, many challenges exist, and evaluation results of adaptive GUIs have been mixed. To guide researchers and designers in developing effective adaptive GUIs, we outline a design space and discuss three important aspects to consider when conducting user evaluations of these types of interfaces: the control and reporting of adaptive algorithm characteristics, the impact of task choice and user characteristics on the overall effectiveness of a design, and evaluation measures that are appropriate for adaptive interaction.
