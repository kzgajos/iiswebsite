<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="content">

``The AI and HCI communities have often been characterized as having opposing views of how humans and computers should interact'' observes Winograd in Shifting Viewpoints. It is time to narrow this gap. What was once considered the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) research can now be found in commercial products. While some have failed, others, such as face detection in digital cameras or product recommendation systems, have become so mainstream they are no longer thought of as artificial intelligence. This special interest group provides a forum to examine the apparent gap between HCI and AI communities, to explore how intelligent technologies can enable novel interaction with computation, and to investigate the challenges associated with understanding human abilities, limitations, and preferences in order to drive the design of intelligent interactive systems.
