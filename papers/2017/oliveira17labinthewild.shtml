<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="content">

We present LabintheWild, an online experiment platform that provides participants with the opportunity to learn about themselves and compare themselves to others. In the past four years, LabintheWild has attracted approximately 3.5 million participants of diverse ages and education levels who came from more than 200 countries and regions. Leveraging our experience with LabintheWild, we show how researchers can design engaging and robust online experiments that provide personalized feedback. In particular, our interactive tutorial highlights challenges and best-practice guidelines for designing volunteer-based online experiments for diverse participant samples.
