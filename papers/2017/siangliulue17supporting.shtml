<p>Online collective ideation platforms, such as OpenIDEO or Quirky, have demonstrated the potential of large-scale collective innovation in various domains. However, the users of these platforms face new challenges of leveraging collective contributions. The large number of collected ideas prevents users from making full use of these ideas. Finding inspirations from the ideas involves wading through a sea of possibly mundane and redundant ideas. Synthesizing a few solutions from these ideas takes a lot of time and e ort. I argue that leaving users to explore ideas in a haphazard manner is ine ective and can decrease the quality of people's creative output. Prior work in cognitive science and creativity research has also suggested that deliberate exploration of the solution space can improve users' creative output and experience.</p><p>I introduce the concept of an idea map, a computational model of the emerging solution space that enables deliberate exploration interactions: 1) presenting a set of ideas with a controlled level of diversity appropriate to the stage of the creative process and 2) presenting a summary view of the solution space.

The second method takes an “integrated crowdsourcing” approach that computes the model from users' natural activities during idea generation.
